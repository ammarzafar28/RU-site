                                RUTA is a charitable tutoring service provided for kids K-8 within the MCECC community. We anticipate
                                opening several other tutoring academies in San Antonio to broaden our reach and truly contribute towards
                                the unification of the city.

                                By promoting volunteerism within the MCECC community, we have already engaged with individuals working in 
                                education to create a curriculum that best serves children in their studies. Through Resources United, our 
                                vision is to create this wonderful engagement in community work throughout every district of San Antonio.

                            Our journey of impact begins with a commitment to service, driving us to engage in a multitude of events in the 
                            Districts of San Antonio. Through our collective dedication, we wish to foster a deep understanding of each district's 
                            unique challenges and aspirations. Our collaboration with different council members has been nothing short of inspiring.

                            As we continue to bridge gaps and break barriers, our experiences in various districts have reinforced the importance 
                            of unity in diversity. Every event, every interaction, and every shared moment has brought us closer to the heartbeats
                            of these communities. Our journey of volunteering across districts stands as a testament to the power of collaboration.
